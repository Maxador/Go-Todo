Go-Todo
=======

This is a little project to learn how to make a RESTful api with [golang](http://www.golang.org/).
The front-end is made with [angular.js](http://www.angularjs.org/) because it's another subject that got my attention lately and I wanted to try it more in depth.

The project is made using a TDD (Test-driven developpement) approach based on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB1hoUJDbk0).

There's no licence on this project. You can do everything you want with the source code.
